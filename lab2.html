    MADHYA PRADESH
    </h1>
    </center>
    <h4 style="color:yellow;">Madhya Pradesh, a large state in central India, retains landmarks from eras throughout
        Indian history. Begun in the 10th century, its Hindu and Jain temples at Khajuraho are renowned for their
        carvings of erotic scenes, most prominently Kandariya Mahadeva, a temple with more than 800 sculptures. The
        eastern Bandhavgarh and Kanha national parks, noted Bengal tiger sanctuaries, offer guided safaris.</h4>
